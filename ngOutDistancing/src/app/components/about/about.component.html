  <p class="mb-0"><b>Out Distancing</b> was created with the intention of promoting <em>social distancing activities and events outdoors</em>.
    During this global pandemic and with strict social distancing guidelines, we encourage people to explore Colorado's natural beauties that are expansive, mountainous and serene.
    Undertake a new activity, join events or just traverse the diverse terrains. In the spirit of exploration, we hope our idea helps you to meet social distancing equanimously.</p>
